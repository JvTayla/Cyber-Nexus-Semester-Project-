First Task Completion
Sparx: “Oh, you actually brought it back. Maybe you are here on a legitimate mission. Here, as promised—a schematic of the ship. This blueprint should prove useful for finding the Experiment room.”
Sparx: “If you wouldn’t mind, could you do me one more favour? The scientists who worked on this ship, Dr Marquez, Dr Tanaka, DR Volkov, Dr Patel and Dr Thompson Elena, Kaz, Anya , Raj and Lena,  we were all pretty close. They relied on me heavily for their day to day tasks. When they left, I couldn’t retrieve all their voice recorders. I’d prefer those recordings not fall into the wrong hands, They have information about the experiments they were running... I believe there are around six left around the ship. Could you bring them back to me?”
