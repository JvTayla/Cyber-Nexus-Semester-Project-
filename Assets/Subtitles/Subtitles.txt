Sparx: System booting up... Intruder alert. Intruder Alert!
Sparx: Hey YOU! This research lab is OFF-LIMITS. Something terrible happened with one of the power reactors and The scientists had to evacuate quickly when radiation levels spiked, and it's not safe for anyone…. 
Sparx: Hey... you kind of look like me. Not like those crooked Nova Stratos robots with their evil, malfunctioning processors and glitchy, rusted joints. What are you doing here?
Player Robots (Wisp and Aurora): We’re here on an important mission. We were sent to retrieve critical data the scientists were working on. We believe it’s in the experiment room.
Sparx: “Analysing... Well, if you’re serious, perhaps you could help me first. Bring me a nuclear battery pod from the storage room. It should be glowing and emit a bright light. Once you have it and bring it back, I’ll assist you in your mission.”
Sparx: “Here, take this! It’ll let you store the items I need from you and give you extra details about objects around the ship.”
